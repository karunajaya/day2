The document object represents the entire HTML document.
It is a child of the window object.
Provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as accessing and modifying HTML elements, handling events, and manipulating the structure of the document.
                 2. window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or a frame.
It is the top-level object in the hierarchy of the browser's JavaScript objects.
Contains properties and methods related to the browser window, such as the location of the window, history, and methods for opening and closing windows.
The document object is a property of the window object, so you can access it as window.document or simply document.

 if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
